# Mini Sudoku ðŸ§©

A simple Sudoku game that you can run in the terminal. Here's a brief explanation of how it works:

It generates a solved Sudoku grid.
It creates a puzzle by removing a specified number of cells from the solved grid.
It allows the player to input row, column and number to fill in the puzzle.
It checks if the input is correct and updates the puzzle accordingly.
The game continues until the puzzle is solved.
The game will prompt you to enter a difficulty level (number of empty cells) and then allow you to play by entering row, column and number for each move.
